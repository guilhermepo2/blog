## Introduction

Everyone knows that 3D Math is important for game development, specially gameplay programming, A very common concept is the dot product, and when searching for it, there is a big lack of concrete examples on where this can be applied, and when you find one, it's always the same old "How do I know when an enemy is looking at the player?" - For that, I wanted to create a series of blog posts, every time I use the dot product, or any 3D Math concept really, I would create a quick and short blog post describing what I wanted to achieve, and how I achieved it.

This is a not blog post about what is the dot product, you can do a quick google search to find its mathematical definition and its interpretation, this is a quick post about using the dot product in a gameplay mechanic.
