# Blog

**Youtube Idea:** Gameplay Autopsies

The idea is to choose a game and talk about its gameplay in a more technical and development oriented way - talk about camera, control and character.

# Where to Write?

Medias I have:
1. Wordpress Game Development Blog (DevLog)
2. Personal Technical Blog
3. Medium

**Medium:** Medium is a platform to share "Ideas on subjects that matter" - so it is not a place for thoughts, maybe not for some technical aspects, but it's good for the writings like *"getting a hobby that doesn't relate to computer science"*, *"Subjects that matter"* nowadays is politics, design and technology, that's what you are going to find on Medium, and not so technical, that's the kind of stuff that should be there.

**Wordpress GameDev Blog:** A DevLog. Things with a certain time frame that are subject to change in a couple days, weeks or months.

**Personal Blog:** Tutorials and more well written posts.
