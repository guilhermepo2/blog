# Where to Write?

Medias I have:
1. Wordpress Game Development Blog
2. Personal Technical Blog
3. Medium

Medias I would also like to have:
1. Game related blog (merge it with personal blog?)
2. ~Anonymous Blogging~

**Blogs:** I have or want to have a lot of fucking blogs, I have to organize it...

SEO? RESULTS ON GOOGLE? THINK ABOUT IT!

**Medium:** Medium is a platform to share "Ideas on subjects that matter" - so it is not a place for thoughts, maybe not for some technical aspects, but it's good for the writings like *"getting a hobby that doesn't relate to computer science"*, *"Subjects that matter"* nowadays is politics, design and technology, that's what you are going to find on Medium, and not so technical, that's the kind of stuff that should be there.

**Wordpress GameDev Blog:** This is where I write about adventures on Game Development land, good place for the writing of character design process, what art type an Indie Game Developer should learn, monthly updates, technical stuff on games, etc... => Maybe it's just good for routine posts, more complex posts maybe should be on the personal blog.

**Personal Blog:** This is the one I want to do to post thoughts and "tutorials", such as the Authentication with Node.JS and Postgres, Evolutive ALgorithms, Text Editor stuff, Restful API, ...
