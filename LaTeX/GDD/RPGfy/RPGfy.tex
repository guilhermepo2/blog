\paragraph{RPGfy my Life will be a classical turn based RPG heavily inspired on the classics of the genre, such as Pokemon and early Final Fantasies.}

\paragraph{The difference is that experience and gold are earned by real life tasks - which can be divided in habits, dailies and to dos. An inspiration for this is Habitica.}

\paragraph{Experience is used to evolve your character and money is used to buy items and lootboxes (gives random items), the possibility of buying fashion stuff is under decision.}

\section*{Story}

\paragraph{The game will proceed with a story just like a regular TBRPG.}

\paragraph{It's still under decision the theme, setting and if the history will be related to habits, productivity or not.}

\section*{Why It Needs to Be Made}

\paragraph{Turn Based RPGs are a good fit for mobiles and are engaging more and more players as time goes by. Apps that gamify your life exists and add an extra flavor to productivity and discipline.}

\paragraph{But there isn't something that mix both worlds.}

\section*{Final Thoughts}

\paragraph{RPGfy my life can be a fun game that will also help you to boost your discipline, productivity and to get things done!}
